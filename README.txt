I've just started out in Python and made this in my spare time to learn a bit more about implementing different APIs and modules.
I will try to add new and interesting things to the bot IF I find any. Have a nice day! :D

Note: This requires Discord.py and OpenAI modules as well as respective API keys.
Discord.py is free to use whereas OpenAI is paid, their pricing is subject to change.
